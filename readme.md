# The chat PhoneBook

A simple phone book web-app created with `riot.js`, `hapi.js`. It allows the user to do basic `CRUD` operations with the phone book contacts.

* The `index` view shows all the contacts (only name is displayed). The trash icon deletes the contact.
* Clicking on a contact opens the `detail` page where the user can see all contact's details and edit the properties.
* The create page allows the user to create a new contact.
